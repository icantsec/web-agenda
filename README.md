# web-agenda
work-in-progress web agenda that can sync with online calendar services.

Designed to run on a raspberry pi with a touchscreen monitor, but can be used on any computer. Host locally with "python -m http.server" then just open it in a browser

**do not host this outside of your local network**



**Current features:** Sync with google calendar, show event information, mark event/task complete (locally)

For google integration, you will need a google calendar api key, obtained by creating a project here: https://console.developers.google.com/project (guide coming soonTM)
